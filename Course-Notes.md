## Week 1
**Basics**

Every github repository has a README file that explains the project.
The github document format is called markdown “.md”
Deepnote uses virtual machine to run code
notebooks have cells with either code, text, or sql
Cells that are text can be edited; see [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) ; these cells are markdowns
.ipynb = interactive python notebook ; it's a jupytr notebook
.py is a python program

**Code**

`pwd` to know present working directory
`ls` 
Create a terminal in deepnote > run the program e.g. hello.py
`vi hello.py` file : allows you to edit from terminal .py without a user interface like the jupyter notebook environment
`gip` need to double check what that is

**Prof's Advice**

He recommends wc3 tutorial on link on his github.
