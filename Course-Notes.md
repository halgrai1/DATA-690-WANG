# Hala Algrain's DATA 690 Course Notes

## Week 1
### In-Class Notes 1.28.2021
**Intro**

- Every github repository has a README file that explains the project.
- The github document format is called markdown “.md”
- Deepnote uses virtual machine to run code
- notebooks have cells with either code, text, or sql
- Cells that are text can be edited; see [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) ; these cells are markdowns
- .ipynb = interactive python notebook ; it's a jupytr notebook
- .py is a python program


**Code**
`pwd` to know present working directory

`ls` 

Create a terminal in deepnote > run the program e.g. hello.py

`vi hello.py` file : allows you to edit from terminal .py without a user interface like the jupyter notebook environment

`gip` need to double check what that is


**Prof's Advice**
1. He recommends wc3 tutorial on link on his github.
2. Learn to use the virtual machine.
